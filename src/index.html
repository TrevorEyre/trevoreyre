        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I have one semester left until I complete my BS in Computer Science at Portland State University. I am crazy about user interface and user experience design. I love diving into the tiny details, to make programs that are simple and enjoyable to use.</p>
        <p>In addition to school, I work full time at a labor management company, where I do a little bit of everything, from writing an online employee scheduling and turnover database, to producing and filming employee training videos.</p>
        <p>When I’m not at work or school, I’m usually at home relaxing, or running around the outdoors somewhere with my wife and dog.</p>
