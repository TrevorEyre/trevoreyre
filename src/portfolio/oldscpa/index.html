            <p>Jack W. Olds &amp; Company is an accounting firm in downtown Portland, Oregon. We were contracted to design a logo for the firm and revamp their website. Olds' website was built with CCH Site Builder, a full website builder and content solution targeted at tax professionals.</p>
            <img src='http://placehold.it/600x600'>
            <p>The CCH Site Builder provides very few options for site customization, so we were extremely limited as far as the overall design of the site. Regardless, we helped the firm to select a new, responsive template from CCH, and customized the content and branding to freshen up the feel of the site as a whole. Luckily, CCH did provide a field to insert custom scripts and styles, so we were able to tweak and improve the original template significantly. Some of these customizations include the banner image, site navigation, staff portraits on the firm profile page, and the form on the contact page.</p>
            <img src='http://placehold.it/600x600'>
            <p>For the logo, we wanted something simple, professional, and versatile. We played around with a number of script-like fonts and layouts before settling on the final version.</p>
