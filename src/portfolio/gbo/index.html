            <p>GBO Fashion is a fashion, beauty and lifestyle blog based in San Francisco, California. We were contracted for a full site redesign, and created a custom WordPress template for the blog from scratch.</p>

            <p>GBOâ€™s trademark is the genuine, light-hearted voice that its creator, Shannon Willardson, uses to speak to her audience. With that in mind, the goal for the project was to come up with a design that was clean and elegant, but still warm and inviting.</p>

            <p>We were very involved with Shannon throughout this project, and helped her out with everything from website design, branding and performance, to content strategy, product placement, and analytics. We even helped with some server maintenance and site security when her blog was a victim of malware.</p>
            <p>Rather than doing the entire redesign and throwing it all up on the site at once, we decided to go with a more incremental approach. We did all the design work on a copy of the blog hosted on our development server, and pushed changes to the live site piece by piece so that we could test the changes, get feedback, and refine the design as we went. Shannon had this to say about her experience working with us.</p>
