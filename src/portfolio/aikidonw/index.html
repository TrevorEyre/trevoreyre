            <p>Aikido Northwest is an Aikido dojo in Portland, Oregon, owned and operated by Craig Fife. Craig contracted us to revamp the dojo's website, as well as help with some server and maintenance issues.</p>

            <p>When we started the project, the Aikido Northwest website was actually infected by malware, and was showing the dreaded red warning screen to users on Chrome. We helped Craig do a full site scan and removed all traces of the malware, purged and reinstalled WordPress, and then migrated the previous site data over after it had been cleaned up. After reviewing his security and hosting, we also helped Craig to migrate to a better, more performant server. Finally, we got Craig set up with Google Webmaster Tools and Search Console, and got the warning screen removed from his site once it was fixed.</p>

            <p>Once the malware was taken care of, we proceeded with the original project to redesign the site. Since this was a pretty simple site with pretty simple needs, we opted to go with a premade template. We helped Craig find a clean, modern template, and updated the content and imagery of the site to match. We also installed several plugins to integrate the Aikido Northwest Facebook feed and photo galleries into the site. Once the installation and customizations were complete, we took Craig through a series of one-on-one training sessions to familiarize him with the new site, and how to make updates and customize the content in the future.</p>
